        <h3>IoT pet feeder using ARDUINO</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Designed and implemented an IOT pet feeder in a 4-person team using Embedded C and Arduino</li>
            <li>It is used to feed the pet automatically. It consists of a Wi-Fi module. The user should make sure the device 
                is connected to Wi-Fi so that the user can dispense the food into the pet feeder bowl with the help of his 
                phone when he cannot feed the pet manually.

        <h3>Retinal Image Segmentation and Disease Classification Using Deep Learning
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This project is implemented using various deep-learning techniques in a team of 4 using Python language.</li>
            <li> The main aim is to segment the retinal vessels and identify a few of the retinal eye diseases like Glaucoma, 
                diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and normal eye. Further, a user-friendly GUI is also developed for disease 
                classification, which predicts the disease with its class probability.</li>
            <li>The deep learning model used for retinal image segmentation is res-u-net. And the model used for 
                classification is RESNET50, VGG16, and EFFICIENTNET-B3.</li>
        </ul>
